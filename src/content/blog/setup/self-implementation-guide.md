### Overview

The process for implementing Assetick will vary for each company. However, there is a general flow that works best for most of our customers:

- Add assets
- Provide the work request (ticketing) link to coworkers
- Set up users
- Train your team to complete work
- Set up preventative maintenance tasks (PMs)

This article will walk you through the steps of quickly setting up your Assetick account and training your team to use the Assetick software.

#### Add Assets

Watch this add asset video for information regarding how to add your first Asset. 

The video above will show you how to add your assets into Assetick. However, if you already have a spreadsheet with your assets, this video about how to import assets will walk you through that process.

Keep in mind that it will be easy to modify and add to the information that you put into Assetick. Don't try to put in every detail about your assets from the beginning. It is more efficient if you get basic asset information in the program to begin with and move to the next step. You can always add more information later on.

#### Provide Work Request (Ticketing) Link to Coworkers

Assetick provides a work request portal where people can submit maintenance tickets.  After setting up your assets, most companies set up the work request portal.

This video will teach you the basics of setting up your work request portal and will teach you some maintenance best practices.

Allowing people to submit work requests can be one of the fastest ways to see the benefits of using Assetick. You will be able to easily manage all of the work requests that get reported.

#### Set Up Preventative Maintenance Tasks (PMs)

To set up your recurring tasks, you will want to create PMs. Watch the PM Setup video to learn how.

(Note: Creating preventative maintenance (PM) schedules is one of the best ways to reduce maintenance costs. Many of our customers have found that proper PMs can reduce expenses by 40%. Assetick has a simple guide to creating a PM plan for your assets.)
